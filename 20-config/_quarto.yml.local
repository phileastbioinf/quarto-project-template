# Local Config
# Sometimes its useful to define local changes to project configuration that are not checked in to version control. You can do this by creating a _quarto.yml.local config file. For example, here we specify that we want to use the execution cache when running locally:

# _quarto.yml.local
# execute:
#   cache: true

# Note that Quarto automatically writes an entry to .gitignore to ensure that .local files are not committed (note that environment variables can also be defined in a similar .local file).
